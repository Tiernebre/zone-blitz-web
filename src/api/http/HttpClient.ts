/**
 * Wrapper over HTTP client operations.
 *
 * Why not just fetch you may ask?
 *
 * There are some benefits to this wrapper approach:
 *
 * - Interface-driven design allows for the HTTP client to evolve over time without affecting other React components.
 * - We can intercept requests and responses to ensure stateful authentication and other things much easier.
 * - Can be mocked and injected into testing suites much easier.
